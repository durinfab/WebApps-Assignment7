# The Organization

Starting from its year of founding, BubbleBoba, with its cutting-edge technology for tea production, launched the Taiwanese bubble tea business locally.
Through the constructing of the BubbleBoba trademark and our continuing extensive costumer support, the first store in this city has expanded into our chain of over 70 branches.
This expansion, with our goal of spreading the footsteps of traditional bubble tea to all parts of the country, demonstrates our first step in the undertaking of such a mission.
We guarantee to provide customers the best of quality and service, strictly only using ingredients shipped directly from Taiwan, all of which approved by FDA, to brew you the freshest and most authentic Taiwanese taste in every sip.
We hereby cordially invite you to take delight in the experience with us.

# The App

In times of lockdown it is important to make available services which can be used safely.
With this app we plan to realise a safer environment for our customers who want to order.
The app should provide a medium for customers to easily place an order without standing in a queue in front of the shop.

To underline the social aspect, even in times where social distancing is important, there should be a feature where everyones order should be listed.
That list should offer an option to rate the order of others and sort the orders by rating.
